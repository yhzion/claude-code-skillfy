# /calibrate review [--dismissed]

Review repeated patterns and promote them to Skills.

## Usage

- `/calibrate review` - Review pending patterns (count >= 2, not promoted, not dismissed)
- `/calibrate review --dismissed` - Review previously dismissed patterns for manual promotion

## Pre-execution Setup

### Step 0: Dependency and DB Check
```bash
set -euo pipefail
IFS=$'\n\t'

# Ensure UTF-8 locale for proper character handling
export LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 2>/dev/null || export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 2>/dev/null || true

# Get project root (Git root or current directory as fallback)
PROJECT_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)
DB_PATH="$PROJECT_ROOT/.claude/calibrator/patterns.db"
# Configurable threshold (default: 2)
THRESHOLD="${CALIBRATOR_THRESHOLD:-2}"
SKILL_OUTPUT_PATH="$PROJECT_ROOT/.claude/skills"

# POSIX-compatible version comparison (returns 0 if $1 >= $2)
version_ge() {
  printf '%s\n%s' "$2" "$1" | awk -F. '
    NR==1 { split($0,a,"."); next }
    NR==2 { split($0,b,".")
      for(i=1; i<=3; i++) {
        if((b[i]+0) > (a[i]+0)) exit 0
        if((b[i]+0) < (a[i]+0)) exit 1
      }
      exit 0
    }'
}

if ! command -v sqlite3 &> /dev/null; then
  echo "❌ Error: sqlite3 is required but not installed."
  exit 1
fi

# SQLite 3.24.0+ required for UPSERT support
SQLITE_VERSION=$(sqlite3 --version 2>/dev/null | awk '{print $1}')
MIN_SQLITE_VERSION="3.24.0"
if ! version_ge "$SQLITE_VERSION" "$MIN_SQLITE_VERSION"; then
  echo "❌ Error: SQLite $MIN_SQLITE_VERSION or higher required. Found: ${SQLITE_VERSION:-unknown}"
  exit 1
fi

if [ ! -f "$DB_PATH" ]; then
  echo "❌ Calibrator is not initialized. Run /calibrate init first."
  exit 1
fi

# Path traversal protection: validate that a path is under allowed directory
# (consistent with calibrate-delete.md and calibrate-refactor.md)
validate_skill_path() {
  local path="$1"
  local resolved_path resolved_base

  # Resolve to absolute path and check it's under SKILL_OUTPUT_PATH
  # realpath -m handles non-existent paths and returns absolute path
  resolved_path=$(realpath -m "$path" 2>/dev/null || echo "")
  resolved_base=$(realpath -m "$SKILL_OUTPUT_PATH" 2>/dev/null || echo "")

  if [ -z "$resolved_path" ] || [ -z "$resolved_base" ]; then
    return 1
  fi

  # Check path starts with base directory
  case "$resolved_path" in
    "$resolved_base"/*) return 0 ;;
    *) return 1 ;;
  esac
}
```

## Flow

### Step 1: Determine Review Mode
Check if `--dismissed` argument was provided:
- If `--dismissed` → Query dismissed patterns
- Otherwise → Query pending patterns (default)

### Step 2: Query Promotion Candidates

**Default mode (pending patterns):**
```bash
# Query patterns meeting threshold that haven't been promoted or dismissed.
# Columns: id, situation, instruction, count, first_seen, last_seen
CANDIDATES=$(sqlite3 -separator $'\t' "$DB_PATH" \
  "SELECT id, situation, instruction, count, first_seen, last_seen FROM patterns WHERE count >= $THRESHOLD AND promoted = 0 AND (dismissed = 0 OR dismissed IS NULL) ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 100;" \
  2>/dev/null) || CANDIDATES=""
```

**Dismissed mode (`--dismissed`):**
```bash
# Query dismissed patterns for manual review.
# Columns: id, situation, instruction, count, first_seen, last_seen
CANDIDATES=$(sqlite3 -separator $'\t' "$DB_PATH" \
  "SELECT id, situation, instruction, count, first_seen, last_seen FROM patterns WHERE dismissed = 1 AND promoted = 0 ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 100;" \
  2>/dev/null) || CANDIDATES=""
```

### Step 3-A: No Candidates (Default Mode)
```
📊 No patterns available for promotion

Patterns need to repeat 2+ times to be promoted to a Skill.
Keep recording with /calibrate.
```

### Step 3-A: No Candidates (Dismissed Mode)
```
📋 No dismissed patterns found

Dismissed patterns are those you previously declined to promote.
Use `/calibrate review` to see pending patterns instead.
```

### Step 3-B: Candidates Found (Default Mode)

Display the candidates list with selection options:
```
📊 Skill Promotion Candidates (2+ repetitions)

[id=12] Model creation → Always include timestamp fields (3 times)
[id=15] API endpoint → Always include error handling (2 times)

Enter pattern id(s) to promote (comma-separated for multiple, or 'skip' to cancel):
Example: 12 or 12,15
```

### Step 3-B: Candidates Found (Dismissed Mode)

Display the dismissed patterns list:
```
📋 Previously Dismissed Patterns

These patterns were declined for automatic promotion.
You can manually promote them now.

[id=12] Model creation → Always include timestamp fields (3 times, dismissed)
[id=15] API endpoint → Always include error handling (2 times, dismissed)

Enter pattern id(s) to promote (comma-separated for multiple, or 'skip' to cancel):
Example: 12 or 12,15
```

Note: The list should be dynamically generated from the CANDIDATES query result.

Wait for user response:
- User responds with id(s) (e.g., "12" or "12,15") → Parse and process each PATTERN_ID
- User responds "skip" or "cancel" → Exit with message: "No patterns promoted."

### Step 4: Load Pattern Details
For each selected `PATTERN_ID`:
```bash
# Validate id defensively
if ! [[ "$PATTERN_ID" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
  echo "❌ Error: Invalid pattern id '$PATTERN_ID'"
  exit 1
fi

ROW=$(sqlite3 -separator $'\t' "$DB_PATH" \
  "SELECT situation, instruction, count, first_seen, last_seen FROM patterns WHERE id = $PATTERN_ID AND promoted = 0;" \
  2>/dev/null) || ROW=""

if [ -z "$ROW" ]; then
  echo "❌ Error: Pattern not found or already promoted (id=$PATTERN_ID)"
  exit 1
fi

IFS=$'\t' read -r SITUATION INSTRUCTION COUNT FIRST_SEEN LAST_SEEN <<<"$ROW"
```

### Step 5: Skill Preview and Confirmation

Display the skill preview:
```
📝 Skill Preview: {situation}

---
name: {kebab-case situation}
description: {instruction}. Auto-applied in {situation} situations.
learned_from: calibrator ({count} repetitions, {first_seen} ~ {last_seen})
---

## Rules

{instruction}

## Applies to

- {situation}

## Learning History

This Skill was auto-generated by Calibrator.
- First detected: {first_seen}
- Last detected: {last_seen}
- Repetitions: {count}
```

Then ask the user for confirmation:

```
What would you like to do with this skill?

1. Save skill (Recommended) - Create the skill file and activate it
2. Edit first - Modify the instruction before saving
3. Skip - Don't create this skill

Select action (1/2/3):
```

Wait for user response:
- User responds "1" or "save" → Proceed to Step 5
- User responds "2" or "edit" → Ask "Enter the modified instruction:" and wait for response, then proceed to Step 5
- User responds "3" or "skip" → Skip this pattern and continue to next (if any)

### Step 6: Skill Creation
On save selection:
```bash
# Generate Skill name (kebab-case) - Path Traversal prevention

```

## Reference: Skill Name Conversion Rules

- Space → hyphen
- Uppercase → lowercase
- Remove special characters
- Example: "Model creation" → "model-creation"
- Example: "API endpoint" → "api-endpoint"
