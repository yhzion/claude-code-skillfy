```

## Usage

### Initialize

```bash
/skillfy init
```

Creates the Skillfy database and directory structure.

> **Note**: Skillfy installs in your Git repository root, or the current directory if not in a Git repository.

<details>
<summary>📖 Detailed Usage</summary>

**What it creates:**
- `.claude/skillfy/patterns.db` - SQLite database
- `.claude/skills/` - Directory for promoted Skills
- Adds entries to `.gitignore` (for Git projects)

**Flow:**

1. **Confirmation:**
   - "Initialize Skillfy?" → [Yes, initialize] [Cancel]

2. **If Already Exists:**
   - "Skillfy already exists" → [Keep] [Reinitialize (delete data)]
   - Note: Schema upgrades are handled via reinitialization. There is no in-place migration; back up your data if needed.

3. **Completion:**
   ```
   Skillfy initialization complete

   - .claude/skillfy/patterns.db created
   - .claude/skills/ directory created
   - .gitignore updated (if Git project)

   You can now record mismatches with /skillfy.
   Use /skillfy review to promote saved patterns to skills.
   ```

## Examples

Two common scenarios to learn how to use Skillfy.

### Example 1: Code Style Preference

Let's walk through a real scenario from start to finish.

#### 😤 The Problem

You ask Claude to create a React component:

```
> Create a Button component
```

Claude responds:
```jsx
const Button = ({ label, onClick }) => {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{label}</button>
}
```

**But you wanted TypeScript interfaces!** This keeps happening...

---

#### 📝 Step 1: Record the Mismatch

Run `/skillfy` right after the mismatch:

```
Situation: > Creating React components
Expected: > TypeScript interface for props
Instruction: > Always define a TypeScript interface for component props

What would you like to do?
> 1. Register as Skill
```

Result:
```
✅ Skill created: .claude/skills/creating-react-components/SKILL.md

🔄 Restart Claude Code to activate this skill.
```

---

#### ✨ Step 2: Result

**Restart Claude Code**, then ask the same question:

```
> Create a Button component
```

Now Claude responds:
```tsx
interface ButtonProps {
  label: string;
  onClick: () => void;
}

const Button = ({ label, onClick }: ButtonProps) => {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{label}</button>
}
```

🎉 **Claude learned your preference and applies it automatically!**

---

### Example 2: Workflow Behavior Preference

Learn how to teach Claude when to act automatically vs. ask for confirmation.

#### 😤 The Problem

You ask Claude to check code quality:

```
> Check lint and format
```

Claude finds issues and asks:
```
Found issues:

| Check    | Status                           |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| ESLint   | ⚠️ 1 warning                     |
| Prettier | ❌ 2 files need formatting       |

Would you like me to fix these issues?
```

**But you wanted Claude to just fix them!** You don't want to be asked every time...

---

#### 📝 Step 1: Record the Mismatch

Run `/skillfy` right after the mismatch:

```
Situation: > When checking lint/format
Expected: > Auto-fix issues without asking and fix first, then report
Instruction: > Fix without asking, report after

What would you like to do?
> 1. Register as Skill
```

Result:
```
✅ Skill created: .claude/skills/when-checking-lintformat/SKILL.md

🔄 Restart Claude Code to activate this skill.
```

---

#### ✨ Step 2: Result

**Restart Claude Code**, then ask the same question:

```
> Check lint and format
```

Now Claude responds:
```
The skill instructs me to fix without asking. Let me fix these issues now.

✅ All issues fixed:

| Check    | Result                                         |
|----------|------------------------------------------------|
| Prettier | ✅ 2 files formatted (App.vue, HelloWorld.vue) |
| ESLint   | ✅ 0 errors, 0 warnings                        |

Changes made:
- src/App.vue — formatting fixed
- src/components/HelloWorld.vue — formatting fixed + added default value
```

🎉 **Claude learned your workflow preference and acts without asking!**

---

#### ⚠️ Note: Skill Activation

Skills may not always trigger automatically. If Claude doesn't apply the skill:

1. **Improve the description** - Make the skill's `description` field more specific
2. **Manual invocation** - You can explicitly invoke it:
   ```
   > Check lint and format. Use skill: when-checking-lintformat
   ```
3. **Check skill loading** - Run `/skillfy help` to verify the skill is recognized

---

## Best Practice

The recommended workflow:

```
1. Work with Claude as usual
       ↓
2. Notice a mismatch? Run /skillfy immediately
       ↓
3. Be specific: "When creating React components" > "When coding"
       ↓
4. Write clear instructions: "Always use TypeScript interfaces"
       ↓
5. Restart Claude Code to activate new Skills
```

**Tips:**
- 📝 Record mismatches **right when they happen** - context matters
- 🎯 Be **specific** about the situation - vague patterns don't help
- ✍️ Write **imperative instructions** - "Always do X" or "Never do Y"
- 🚀 After creating Skills, **restart Claude Code** to load them

## How It Works

1. **Record**: Log situations where Claude's output didn't match expectations with `/skillfy`
2. **Save or Promote**: Either save as memo for later or create Skill immediately
3. **Review**: Use `/skillfy review` to promote saved patterns to Skills
4. **Apply**: Once promoted to a Skill, Claude automatically applies it in similar situations

## Data Storage

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.claude/skillfy/patterns.db` | SQLite DB (`patterns`, `schema_version` tables) |
| `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Promoted Skills |

### Skill Naming Rules

When a skill is created, the name is automatically generated from the situation:

| Rule | Example |
|------|---------|
| Convert to lowercase | "Creating Models" → "creating-models" |
| Replace spaces with hyphens | "API endpoint" → "api-endpoint" |
| Remove special characters | "React (TSX)" → "react-tsx" |
| Maximum 50 characters | Truncated if longer |
| Collision handling | Adds suffix: `-1`, `-2`, etc. |

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- **patterns.db may contain sensitive data**: The database stores situations and expectations you record. Be mindful of what information you include.
- **Automatic .gitignore**: The init command automatically adds `.claude/skillfy/` to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits.
- **Review skill files before committing**: Generated skills in `.claude/skills/` are NOT gitignored. Review them for sensitive context before committing to version control.
- **Backup exclusions**: Consider excluding `.claude/skillfy/` from cloud sync services if it contains sensitive information.

### File Permissions

Secure permissions are **automatically set** during initialization:

| Path | Permission | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| `.claude/skillfy/` | `700` (rwx------) | Owner only: read, write, execute |
| `.claude/skills/` | `700` (rwx------) | Owner only: read, write, execute |
| `patterns.db` | `600` (rw-------) | Owner only: read, write |

### Input Validation
- SQL injection is prevented through quote escaping
- Path traversal is prevented in skill name generation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"sqlite3 is required but not installed"**
- macOS/Linux: sqlite3 is typically pre-installed
- Windows: Install from https://sqlite.org/download.html

**Skills not being applied**
- Ensure the skill was properly created (check `/skillfy help` for status)
- Verify the skill file exists in `.claude/skills/`
- **Restart Claude Code** to load new skills

## Requirements

- Claude Code
- sqlite3 CLI (pre-installed on macOS/Linux)
- SQLite version 3.24.0+ (for improved performance and compatibility)
- `realpath` or `python3` (for path resolution in review command; typically pre-installed)
